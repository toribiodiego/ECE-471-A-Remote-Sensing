> This repository contains the code for **ECE471: Fundamentals of Remote Sensing and Earth Observation**—a course offered in Spring 2025. Under the guidance of **Professor Krishna Karra**, it features programming assignments focused on the analysis of geospatial data using tools such as GDAL, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, and essential Python libraries.

## Course Overview

In *Remote Sensing*, students learn the fundamentals of remote sensing and Earth observation by working with diverse geospatial datasets and GIS tools. The curriculum covers key topics including geospatial data types, coordinate reference systems, projections, and cartography, as well as remote sensing indices like NDVI, NDWI, and NBR. 

Students gain practical experience using both classical and machine learning methods to process satellite imagery from sources such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and more. The course emphasizes hands-on learning through assignments that blend image processing, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques, ultimately preparing students to tackle real-world Earth observation challenges through an individual final project.


## Codebase Structure

- **P01.ipynb** – *Satellite Imagery Analysis*  
  This project simulates a real-world consulting scenario for New Mexico by analyzing Sentinel-2 imagery over the greater Santa Fe area. The assignment includes exploring the dataset, creating visualizations, processing images for consistent spatial properties, and generating composite images. It also features tasks such as developing cloud masks and analyzing pixel value distributions—all aimed at building a comprehensive understanding of geospatial data processing.

- **P02.ipynb** – *Crop Prediction and Seasonal Analysis*  
  This assignment focuses on using the Cropland Data Layer and Landsat imagery to predict crop types in Iowa and Illinois. It begins with ranking crop prevalence using acreage data, followed by an exploration of seasonal vegetation patterns through NDVI time series analysis. The project culminates in the development, testing, and deployment of a crop classification model designed to produce accurate in-season predictions by integrating geospatial analysis with machine learning techniques.
