This map, which incorporates Landsat and Sentinel imagery from across the year, represents some of the highest quality, rigorously validated land cover classification that can be found anywhere.\n\nA year's annual map is usually released a few months into the next year (e.g. the 2020 CDL is released towards the end of the first quarter of 2021). As a geospatial consultant, your task is to investigate whether certain crop types could be predicted *in-season* (e.g. without using a full year's worth of imagery).\n\nThe CDL is used within government and industry for crop health monitoring, crop area estimation, agricultural policy development, environmental monitoring, yield forecasting and more. In-season prediction of crop types would be vastly useful for all of these applications.\n\nFor this pilot study, the focus will be on Iowa and Illinois.\n\n## Problem Overview\n\nThe overall workflow will be:\n\n1. Analyze cropland data to identify the 5 most prevalent crops grown in Iowa and Illinois.\n2. Explore and visualize the seasonal patterns of those 5 crops using vegetation index time series analysis.\n3. Develop a crop identification model that takes satellite imagery as input and predicts crop type at the pixel level.\n4. Assess model performance using validation data and metrics.\n5. Apply the model to full counties to produce crop type maps and compare against ground truth data.\n\nThe core data sources will be:\n\n1. Cropland Data Layer (CDL) for crop type ground truth labels\n2. Landsat satellite imagery for model inputs\n3. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for analysis and modeling\n\nThis assignment will give you real, concrete experience with:\n\n- Working with large-scale geospatial data\n- Time series analysis of vegetation indices\n- Developing and validating a remote sensing model\n- Creating meaningful data visualizations and maps\n\nYour modeling approach and additional data sources are flexible. The key deliverables are: ranked crop list, crop seasonal analysis, trained crop identification model, model evaluations, and final county-level crop maps.","metadata":{"id":"s3dKnPQ3YnoY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Task 1: Identify Most Prevalent Crops\n\n###*Goal: Plan to have made significant progress on Task 1 (or completed it) by March 5.*\n\nThe goal of this task is to create a ranked list of the most commonly grown crops across Iowa and Illinois based on acreage data from the 2019 Cropland Data Layer (CDL).\n\nSpecifically, you should:\n\n1.

The model should be trained on the sampled points from Task 2 and output predictions for the 5 major crops plus a \"other\" class.\n\nKey Requirements:\n\n- Use sampled crop points (or sampling script) from Task 2 as training data.\n- You may want to include more samples for the model than what was created in Task 2.\n- Input features must include, but are not limited to, Landsat surface reflectance imagery from the growing season.\n- Incorporate temporal vegetation indices like NDVI time series.\n- Output predictions for the 5 major crops identified in Task 1 plus an \"other\" class. This \"other\" class could be expanded into multiple classes if deemed useful.\n- Document modeling methodology including:\n  - Model type, input features, training approach\n  - Any data preprocessing/augmentation\n  - Tools and libraries used\n  - Modeling can be fully in GEE or combine external tools like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc.\n\nRemember that ideally, we are attempting to build a model that does NOT require data across the entire year. Put another way, the less data our model needs about the growing season to make a good prediction about the crop type, the better!\n\nIf this proves challenging, start by using an entire year's worth of data for your model (like CDL). Achieving good performance with your classifier with a full year's worth of data will earn you full credit, and extra credit will be given to in-season prediction.","metadata":{"id":"LaxIlkqHdJr8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Task 3.2: Model Testing\n\nValidate the performance of the developed crop classification model using accuracy metrics calculated on a held-out test set. This test set can be created with the same sampling strategy from before, but should be created indepdently of the training and validation data (e.g. not be seen by the model at all before testing).\n\nKey Requirements:\n\n- Reserve 10-20% of the training data to hold out for testing.\n- Calculate precision, recall and F1 score metrics on the test set.\n- Generate a confusion matrix showing per-class accuracies and errors.\n- Analyze the results - where does the model perform well or poorly?\n- The validation script must enable testing on new unseen data.\n\nInterpret what the results imply about the real-world viability of the model.

If your model however was built outside of GEE and you had to export lots of data to run your mode, you may need to ingest results back into GEE (if needed) for visualization and comparison.\n\nAnalyze similarities and differences between your model output and the CDL. Do they line up at all? Is your approach viable for real-world deployment?

Begin by testing workflows on small counties before expanding to the full two states. This will help identify any issues early.\n- Leverage the vast data in GEE! The Cropland Data Layer and Landsat imagery on GEE provide a rich dataset. But feel free to incorporate any other relevant data sources available.\n- Plan exporting data from GEE! For large regional analysis, you may need to batch export preprocessed data to your local environment for modeling.\n- Store off computationally heavy intermediate results! you may want to store intermediate FeatureCollections and Images as GEE assets such that you do not have to dynamically re-create them every time.\n- Documentation is key! Thoroughly document your methodology, thought process, experiments, and results. This transparency is important for full credit.\n- Visualizations tell a story! Use insightful visuals like time series plots and comparison maps to showcase your findings.\n- There are many valid approaches! This assignment is open-ended by design. There are many \"correct\" ways to analyze the data and build models.\n- Ask questions early! Please reach out if you need any guidance or get stuck.
